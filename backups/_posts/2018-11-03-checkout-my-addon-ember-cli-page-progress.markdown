Major news, everyone.

After using Ember about one and half year, I released my very first ember addon: [ember-cli-page-progress](https://github.com/tigressbailey/ember-cli-page-progress).

It's such a pleasant journey these years. I've learned solid techniques with some soft skills.
To contribute the community, that feels good.

Keep code simple, beautiful and readable are my lines. I consider this addon as a handy tool and the code has good readability.


I'll continue this as lots of things can inspire me all the time.

Please feel free to try it at [https://tigressbailey.github.io/ember-cli-page-progress/](https://tigressbailey.github.io/ember-cli-page-progress/)
