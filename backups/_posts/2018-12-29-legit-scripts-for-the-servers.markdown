# traceroute

`traceroute` is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network

```
traceroute example.com
```

# vim

https://vimgifs.com/

https://linuxmoz.com/vi-commands-cheat-sheet/

```
u (undo)
control + r (redo)
dd  (delete the line)
/keyword (search word)
n (move forward to next search result)
N (move backward to previous search result)
:q! (discard change and quit)
:wq (save change and quit)
```

# ssh

### access the home directory

```
cd ~
```

### create keygen

```
cd ~/.ssh/
```

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

### view keygen locally

```
less keyname
less keyname.pub
```

```
cat ~/.ssh/my_key.pub
```

### vps routine

Log as root

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ my_key root@128.199.166.66
```

### Check server status

```
top
```
htop is better one than just top

#### htop

```
apt-get install htop

htop
```

### regular update (prefer once a week)

```
apt-get update
```

# Monitor the latest log(Important for checking potential security issue)

### tail the log file

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

### add user

```
adduser username
```

### Grant user access

```
usermod -aG sudo username
```

### Confirm the group is assigned
```
id -G -n username
```

## Manage user

### Change pwd

```
passwd username
```

### switch user

```
su username
```

and

```
exit
```

Will be back to the root user.

### sudo user access to visit file

```
cat /var/log/auth.log
```

It will go for `permission denied`

```
sudo !!
```

or

```
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log
```

### ssh with the just created user

```
ssh username@128.199.166.66
```

If the console reports `permission denied (publickey)`, please do following:

1. Open the ssh config
```
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
2. Modify below config
```
UsePAM yes
IgnoreUserKnownHosts no
PasswordAuthentication no
```
to
```
UsePAM no
IgnoreUserKnownHosts no
PasswordAuthentication yes
```
and save the change
3. restart ssh service
```
service ssh restart
```
Problem resolved!
Let's ssh again and login to the server now.
But watch out, login server via the pwd is dangerous. Let introduce a much safer way below.

### ssh server only with private key

It is much better secure comparing to just pwd.

```
cat my_key.pub | ssh username@128.199.166.66 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

What did these lines do?

1. print public key
2. ssh to the server with the username
3. try to create `.ssh` folder
4. copy public key content to the `authorized_keys` file

And it might ask about the pwd.

Juts type in and hit enter.

Now login without pwd.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_key -p 1234 username@128.199.166.66
```

### Disabled root auth and password auth for security

1. open the sshd_config
```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
2. change below two configs
```
PermitRootLogin yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
```
to
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```
Save the changes and quit
3. restart the service
```
sudo service ssh restart
```

# Domain

1. buy a domain name. Of course!
2. setup 2 `A Record`. That means:
```
Type: choose 'A Record'
Host: one is '@', another is 'www'
value: 128.199.166.66
```
3. check the domain is mapping correctly
```
nslookup domain.com
```
It will list the domain info.


# Prepare the server - Nginx

1. ssh to the server. Of course!
2. install Nginx
```
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
3. start the service
```
sudo service nginx start
```
Go and verify it via the domain or ip address
4. check the config
```
cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
or
```
less /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

# Prepare the environment

1. install git
```
sudo apt-get install git
```

2. install nodejs and npm(And yes! NodeJs please. Not node!!!)
```
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```
3. Type `node -v` and see whether the env is in the node env.
If it is not working, symlink `nodejs` to `node` using
```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

# Setup `www` folder

1. Type below command.
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www
```

2. Change ownership from `root` to the choose user

Before that, let's see who is the owner of the folder.
```
ls -l /path/to/file/or/folder
```

Then.
```
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www
```
or specify user and group
```
sudo chown -R username:usergroup /var/www
```
Be careful with this command and only use it when the user really need the all the permission to one folder.

3. Cleanup the unused folders
```
rmdir tmp tmp2
```
or
```
rmdir tmp*
```

4. Correct the folder name
```
mv incorrectname correctname
```

Choose one and follow the instructions.
