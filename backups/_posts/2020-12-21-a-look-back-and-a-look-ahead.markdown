2020 is about to come to an end.

I'm not a person who summarized every year and planned every year.

To adapt Objectivism, I always target at an independent, unique and kind person so that time is timeless.

During the year of Covid-19 virus, I have experienced the longest Spring festival with my grands, the remote work, the conflicts against the product vice president who always applied the hopeless backward planning to the software engineering industry, the recession for the first half year. Then, the lay-off, the interviews and the new job. Everything seems to be all right. But I finally decide to have a free Christmas within this year.

To be a problem solver, let's have a quick summary for the contributions to my present company:

1. Reduce the recompiling time from 30 seconds to 1 seconds.
1. Apply fast refresh feature to the multiple entires project.
1. Set up Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Set up StyleLint and specify all the rules.
1. Set up ESLint and specify all the rules.
1. Apply online debugging ability to the production environment using the hidden sourcemap.
1. Apply Proper logger using Sentry platform.
1. Apply agile process to different production lines and quantify the critical indexes.
1. Reduce bundle size as attached.

    - Bundle names and sizes after optimization:

    - Published form bundle sizes before optimization:

1. Continuously reduce bug rate as attached.

1. Interviewed almost 10 engineers including junior levels and senior levels.

The last one reminds me one of the latest interview experiences is not so comfortable as I expected.

Below are my interview precautions:

1. I always dress properly no matter I'm the interviewer or interviewee.

1. I always respect the interviewee and never interrupt them when they are talking.

1. I always remind myself that I'm not a Ms.know it all and he/she is not Mr/Ms.know it all neither.

1. I always treat the interviewee using the same standard and same questions.

1. To reply to some rude behaviors and people, I still treat them with proper manner.

And to the unpredictable 2021, my adventure would continue with passion and humbleness.

Cheers to the past, present and future.
