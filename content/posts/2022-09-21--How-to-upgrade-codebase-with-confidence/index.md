Remain a resilient architecture is vital, especially when the codebase dependencies will be outdated as time goes by.
As a mature engineering team, it is the vital task to update the codebase every year.

In this blog post, first of all, I'm gonna explain "why" and "what".
Then I'll use my expertise to explain "how" to upgrade the codebase with confidence.

### Why
1. An outdated codebase is not secure.
   Technically, the outdated dependencies put the codebase in danger. It reports vulnerability issues every year.
2. An outdated codebase cannot use the latest framework or programming language features.
   For instance, Next.js 12 is using SWC - a rust compiler instead for a better performance. If the codebase is still using 9 or 10, the CI/CD time will be much longer than 12.
3. An outdated codebase has lower maintainability, scalability and reliability.
   
4. An outdated codebase's developer experience is not efficient.
