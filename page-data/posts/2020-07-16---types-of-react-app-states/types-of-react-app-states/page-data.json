CSS is the most hard part that I tried to avoid organizing them like Bootstrap did in a couple of years ago. I mean, Bootstrap is big. But I wanted to think through the styling independently, just like how I dress everyday.</p>\n<p>Second, use React along with an traditional website.</p>\n<p>Third, categorize the states based on my experience. And a recommendation from Steve Kinney. Here we go.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modal data: The actual data in your application.\nFor instance, catalogs, catalog of products.</li>\n<li>UI state: Sort those modal data in ascending or descending order.\nFor instance, filters and orders.</li>\n<li>Session state: User relative status.\nFor instance, user roles, user access, user login state.</li>\n<li>Communication: The status of CRUD the data from the server.\nFor instance, hasLoaded, loading, error, updating.</li>\n<li>Location: The roads of the APP.\nFor instance, client routing, url.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or, it might make sense to think about state relative to time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modal state: This is likely the date in your application. This could be the items in a given list.</li>\n<li>Ephemeral state: Stuff like the value of an input field that will be wiped away when you hit ‘enter’. This could the order in which a given list is sorted.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-07-16---types-of-react-app-states/types-of-react-app-states","tagSlugs":["/tag/frontend/","/tag/web-development/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-07-16T12:40:32.169Z","description":"","tags":["Frontend","Web Development"],"title":"Types of React APP States","socialImage":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020-07-16---types-of-react-app-states/types-of-react-app-states"}},
