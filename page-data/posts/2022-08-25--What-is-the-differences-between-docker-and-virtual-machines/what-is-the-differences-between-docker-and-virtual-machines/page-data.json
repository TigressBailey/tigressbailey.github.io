But the OS Kernel layer is the same.</p>\n<p>The vital difference between Docker and Virtual Machine is Docker virtualized the application layer. Virtual Machine virtualized both the application layer and OS kernel layer.\nAccording the different virtualized setup, we can list some key points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Docker image size is much smaller</li>\n<li>Docker container is faster</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, it looks like Docker just win it all. Please don’t forget below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Virtual Machine images support crossing-platforms.</li>\n<li>Docker images cannot support crossing-platforms without Docker Toolbox.
